## Usage

# IMPORTANT:
Make sure your gitconfig file is configured. You must configure at least the `user.email` and `user.name` variables.

Also, the package currently favors an ssh setup that doesn't expect to be prompted for credentials in order to push/pull, .etc. Github has a guide to help you set that up [here](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/)

If you are on a Windows machine, I recommend checking out [this thread](https://github.com/akonwi/git-plus/issues/224) if you have issues pushing/pulling from a remote repository with this package.

### Showing the Git-Plus Palette
>- `Cmd-Shift-H` on MacOS
>- `Ctrl-Shift-H` on Windows + Linux
>- `Git Plus: Menu` on the atom command palette.

### Push/Pull/Fetch notifications
Notifications will appear in a console output above the status bar.
This view can be toggled by clicking the pin icon in the bottom right of the status bar.
