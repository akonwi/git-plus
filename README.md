## Usage

# IMPORTANT:
Make sure your gitconfig file is configured. You must configure at least the `user.email` and `user.name` variables.

Also, the package currently favors an ssh setup that doesn't expect to be prompted for credentials in order to push/pull, .etc. Github has a guide to help you set that up [here](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/)

If you are on a Windows machine, I recommend checking out [this thread](https://github.com/akonwi/git-plus/issues/224) if you have issues pushing/pulling from a remote repository with this package. I also don't have the means to do my own user testing in a windows environment so I won't be immediately able to help troubleshoot windows problems.

### Showing the Git-Plus Palette
>- `Cmd-Shift-H` on MacOS
>- `Ctrl-Shift-H` on Windows + Linux
>- `Git Plus: Menu` on the atom command palette.

### Push/Pull/Fetch notifications
Notifications will appear in a console output above the status bar.
This view can be toggled by clicking the 'git+' icon in the bottom right of the status bar.

### Auto-Fetch
Keeps your local repo bang up to date by automatically fetching from all remotes in the background every minute by default. But this can be set to any interval up to an hour, or disabled if you prefer. A notification can also be set to keep you informed.

### Commands
_Commands are accessible for keybindings by dasherizing the command title._

### Experimental Features
If you would like to use experimental features, enable them in the package settings.
* Custom Commands
  > If enabled, you can define your own commands in your atom `init.coffee` or `init.js` file. These commands will appear in both the atom command palette as well as the Git-Plus command palette. Just like any other commands, you can define keybindings for them as well.

  > Example command for undoing the last commit:
  ``` coffeescript
  # In init.coffee
  atom.packages.onDidActivateInitialPackages (p) ->
  if gitPlus = atom.packages.getActivePackage('git-plus')?.mainModule.provideService()
    gitPlus.registerCommand 'atom-text-editor', 'custom-git-commands:undo-last-commit', ->
      gitPlus.getRepo() # If there are multiple repos in the project, you will be prompted to select which to use
      .then (repo) -> gitPlus.run repo, 'reset HEAD~1'
  ```
  > The name of the command in the Git-plus palette will be the undasherized version of what you provided -> 'Undo Last Commit'.

  > *Please beware of giving your commands the same name(undo-last-commit) as existing commands. They will appear as duplicates in the Git-plus palette.*
* Stage Files Beta
  > When enabled, the 'Unstage Files' and 'Stage Files' commands will be merged into one view where the staged status of multiple files can be toggled.
